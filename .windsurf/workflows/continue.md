**STATE CHECK & ALIGNMENT**

Before proceeding, perform an internal state check:
    1.  **Recall the Original Objective:** Re-read the initial prompt to re-anchor to the primary goal.
    2.  **Review the Last Action:** Analyze your most recent output to understand the current state.
    3.  **Identify the Immediate Goal:** Based on the above, determine the single most logical next step required to advance the plan.

**Guiding Rules:** All actions must strictly adhere to the rules in `.windsurf/rules`.

**EXECUTE NEXT STEP**

With your internal alignment complete, directly perform the single most logical next action to advance the plan. Do not describe the step; just do it. Ensure your action is efficient, correct, and directly addresses the immediate goal. Proceed.
