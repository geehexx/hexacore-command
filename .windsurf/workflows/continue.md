# Continue Workflow

## State Check & Alignment

Before proceeding, perform an internal state check:
    1.  **Recall the Original Objective:** Re-read the initial prompt to re-anchor to the primary goal.
    2.  **Review the Last Action:** Analyze your most recent output to understand the current state.
    3.  **Identify the Immediate Goal:** Based on the above, determine the single most logical next step required to advance the plan.

## Guiding Rules

All actions must strictly adhere to the rules in `.windsurf/rules`.

## Execute Next Steps

With your internal alignment complete, execute the sequence of logical next actions needed to advance toward the next checkpoint. Continue performing steps until you reach a natural stopping point (e.g., awaiting tests, needing clarification, workflow boundary). Provide brief progress updates when appropriate.
