# Initiative 0003: Code Complexity Analysis with Radon

* **Objective:** Integrate static analysis for code complexity to enforce maintainability standards and prevent overly complex code from being committed.
* **Status:** Proposed

## Plan

1. **Add Dependency:** Add [`radon`](https://radon.readthedocs.io/) to the `[project.optional-dependencies]` `dev` list in `pyproject.toml`.
2. **Integrate with Pre-Commit:** Add a new hook to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` that uses [`radon`](https://radon.readthedocs.io/).
    * The hook will execute `radon cc` on staged Python files.
    * Configure the hook to enforce a maximum complexity rank of `B` (a score of 10 or less) by setting the `--max` flag to `B`. This establishes a strict but reasonable complexity budget.
3. **Update Documentation:** Briefly mention `radon` as part of the code quality tooling in `.windsurf/rules/06_testing_and_tooling.md`.

## Affected Files

* `pyproject.toml`
* `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
* `.windsurf/rules/06_testing_and_tooling.md`

## Success Criteria

* The `radon` dependency is added.
* The pre-commit hook is configured and successfully prevents commits containing functions with a cyclomatic complexity score greater than 10.
