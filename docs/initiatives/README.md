# Initiatives Directory Guide

Initiative briefs live directly under `docs/initiatives/` as Markdown files (e.g., `0002-mvp-ui-implementation.md`).

Store supporting artifacts for an initiative under `docs/initiatives/artifacts/<initiative-slug>/`. For example,
assets for Initiative 0002 reside in `docs/initiatives/artifacts/0002-mvp-ui-implementation/`.

Once an initiative is implemented and its living documentation is updated, archive both the initiative brief and its
artifacts according to the documentation lifecycle.
