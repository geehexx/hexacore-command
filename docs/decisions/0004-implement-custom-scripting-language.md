# 4. Implement a Custom Scripting Language for Bot AI

* **Status:** Accepted
* **Context:** We need a secure, sandboxed, and thematically appropriate way for players and level designers to define bot behavior.
* **Decision:** Create a custom, BASIC-like language called "Hexa-Script" using the `sly` parsing library.
* **Consequences:** Provides full control over the bot's capabilities and prevents security risks. Creates a fun, retro programming experience for the player.
